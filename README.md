# MY SALON

The reason I designed this app was because I am a hairstyling myself; I started out working at a walk-in basis chain salon called Magicuts (they're all accross North America) and being there I noticed a few things:

- How busy it would get; which caused confusion.
- How often appointments would get mixed up or overlooked due to not having a receptionist.
- How often miscommunication errors happened over the phone.

From creating an app that allows people to book at their favourite walk-in salon ahead of time, it'll not only help the clients, but also the stylists and management as well!


## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to showcase my app in a very creative manner. Namely, I will be using this as a portfolio piece. My goal is to creative a simple, yet eye-catching website that will intrigue the viewer and want to ask me questions about my app design and concept.
